Functions and Methods

 [ Functions ]

  ==> Key Function Parts

    - Calling the function should be readable.
    - The number and order of Arguments should be clear.
    - Function body should be readable.
    - The length of function body matters.

  ==> Minimize the no of Parameters.
  ==> Try to avoid output arguments - especially if they are unexpected.
  ==> createId(user) -> wrong,  addId(user) --> Good,  user.addId(); --> best.

  ==> Functions should do exactly one Thing
  ==> Function should do work that's one level of abstraction below their name
    e.g 
        function emailIsValid(email) {
          return email.includes('@');
        }
  ==> Function should not have mixed levels of abstraction.
  ==> Don't write the same code for more than once.

  ==> Try keeping the functions pure --> The same input yields ( generates ) the same output.
  ==> Pure functions should not have side effects.
  [ Side Effect ] --> A side effect is an operation which does not just act on function input 
                      and change the functino output but which instead changes the overall system/program state.

    e.g let lastAssignedId;
        function generateId(userName) {
          const id = '_id' + userName;
          lastAssignedId = id;    // Side Effect;
          return id;
        }

  ==> Avoid unexpected sideEffects.
  ==> Name of function should imply that a side effect is likely to occure.
